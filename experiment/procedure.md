### Procedure

1.	Click on the die to select it and pour wax into it to make wax pattern.
2.	Once a wax pattern is produced, now click on the wax sprue which is assembled with other wax components on a central wax stick, to form a casting cluster or assembly.
3.	Drag the wax patterns to fix them on the sprue with gas lighter. Repeat the process for all the patterns.
4.	The entire wax assembly is then dipped in a ceramic slurry and covered with a sand stucco and allowed to dry.
5.	Again, the dipping and stuccoing process is repeated until a shell of ~6-8 mm (1/4-3/8 in) is applied.
6.	Once the ceramic has dried, the entire assembly is placed in a furnance to remove most of the wax. 
7.	All the residual pattern and gating material is removed, and the ceramic mould remains.
8.	Now the mould is filled with molten metal, creating the metal casting.
9.	Wait for the casting to cool it sufficiently.
10.	The mould shell is then chipped away from the casting by knock-out process.
11.	The gates and runners are cut from the casting.
12.	Now, post processing process (sand blasting, machining, etc.) is performed to give casting a final touch.
